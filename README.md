## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic MIDI Note Playing
```cpp
#include <SAM2695Synth.h>

SAM2695Synth synth;

void setup() {
  synth.begin();
  synth.setInstrument(0, 0);  // Set channel 0 to piano sound
}

void loop() {
  // Play middle C (note 60)
  synth.noteOn(0, 60, 100);
  delay(500);
  synth.noteOff(0, 60);
  delay(500);
}
```

### Multi-track Chord Performance
```cpp
#include <SAM2695Synth.h>

SAM2695Synth synth;

void setup() {
  synth.begin();
  synth.setInstrument(0, 0);   // Piano
  synth.setInstrument(1, 24);  // Nylon Guitar
  synth.setInstrument(9, 0);   // Drum channel
}

void loop() {
  // C major triad - Piano
  synth.noteOn(0, 60, 100); // C
  synth.noteOn(0, 64, 100); // E
  synth.noteOn(0, 67, 100); // G
  
  // Guitar accompaniment
  synth.noteOn(1, 48, 80);
  
  // Bass drum
  synth.noteOn(9, 36, 120);
  
  delay(1000);
  
  // Turn off all notes
  synth.allNotesOff();
  delay(500);
}
```
